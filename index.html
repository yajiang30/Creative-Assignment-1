    1. This webpage is about my hobby of cooking and eating delicious food. It showcases some pictures of meals I have made.
    2. Since, I'm not that good at designing, the webpage has a pretty simple layout. I looked for color schemes on colorhunt
    and found a nice Easter/pastel theme. This color scheme has proven to be aesthetically pleasing with over 26,000 likes
    on color hunt https://colorhunt.co/palette/b1b2ffaac4ffd2daffeef1ff. I didn't choose a particular font since the default 
    one was already readable and looked nice.
    3. I used media query at the breakpoint 768px for mobile since it was what most people on the internet used.
    I tried to make my images flexible and responsive but it wasn't working when I zoomed out, but it did stay inside the box.
    4. All of my images conatined an alt attribute which describes the image. Made sure to set language to English in the
    html tag and used article and section tags for SEO.
    5. This project was meaningful beacause it allowed me to showcase my cooking with web development. I had some troubles
    with implementing responsive images when the site was zoomed out and it took a while to get the arrow working.

      <h1>Cooking</h1>
      <p>
        I enjoy cooking for myself everyday. I find it relaxing coming home
        and cooking dinner. I enjoy planning meals ahead or embrace my
        creative side by just taking a look at what I have in the fridge and
        making something on the fly. I like every cuisine and is always
        looking forward to trying to make new dishes.

      <h2>Japanese Food</h2>
      <p>
        I remember going to Japantown with my parents all the time and
        grabbing a bento from the supermarket. Japanese food is my favorite
        because the flavor is simple but delicious. I learned how to make
        Japanese food mainly from YouTube.

      <h2>Other Cuisines</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy all types of food. Growing up in San Francisco, I got to try
        all types of cuisines. Mexican, Korean, Greek, Vietnamese, Italian,
        and many more. Making Chinese food while being away from home reminds
        me of the home cooked meals I used to eat everyday.
